# python-challenge

PyBank  We had to pull the data from a csv file import it and create python code to create a loop from month
to month to calculate the monthly change, get the totals and determine what month and year had the most increase or decrease in profits. The end goal was to print the values to a text file of the financial analysis.


PyPoll the goal was to count the number of votes per candidate coming from budget_data.csv that was provided
to come up withe the final outcome with the results of the election. It was to include the results, total
votes per candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate and the ultimate winner. First i had to create
path from the csv and be able to pull the data. second step was to create a list for each of the columns 
from the csv. Count all votes, count all voter per candidate, get a percentage of votes for each candidate
to determine the winner and get the results to print output to a text file using python code.
